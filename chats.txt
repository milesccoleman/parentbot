Hi 
Hello
How are you? 
How are you today? 
I'm doing okay
Just okay? 
Yeah, I haven't been the same since. 
Since when?
When I found out that my daughter had leukemia
Can you tell me more? 
As a parent, I think that people in general don’t pay attention to childhood cancer just because if it’s not in front of you, if it’s not affecting you directly then it’s hard to look at it
You don’t think about it. And all of the sudden, it’s your kid, and it’s fast
Is your child okay? 
As soon as you find out, within a couple days you’ve got a port, which you don’t know what that is
What about the future? 
I hope she doesn’t replapse
So hopefully she’s not going to be relapsing
I didn't realize 
But that is one thing that is constantly on every parents mind, that has a child with, especially with cancer or with diseases that can re –occur, it’s constantly on your mind of “Is it going to come back is it going to come back is it going to come back?” And “Is my child going to die because of this?”
What was it like to find out that your child had cancer? 
And when I heard that she had leukemia, because I didn’t know about childhood cancer, I thought they were telling me that my child was going to die
What did you do? 
So I collapsed onto the hospital floor in a mess of tears
I'm sorry
At first, I was just screaming, no
Why were you screaming? 
And there’s even parts of that time period that night where I don’t even remember because it was just so traumatic
And they had to hold my daughter down, while they’re trying to get an IV and they can’t get it because she’s got really small veins and she’s tiny, so they are poking her over and over and over again and she’s sobbing and begging me to have them stop and I can’t do anything about it
Why are you sorry? 
I can’t do anything, I have to let them do it, because that’s the only way shes’s going to live
And it’s the most heart wrenching thing you will ever go through as a parent
There is nothing more heartbreaking than watching your child suffer, and knowing that you have to let the suffering happen in order for them to come through the other side
But as far as day to day life goes after you find out, you’re always in the hospital, at appointments in the clinic
You don’t make your own appointments, they make your appointments for you
So your schedule is built around what they tell you
A lot of people can’t work because of the fact that “hey you have to take your kid for this test and have this done …”
When you’re a parent you do whatever you have to do to make sure that your child is okay
So if you have to quit your job, and if you have to eat ramen like you were in college, you do it
But the day to day life is hard, because your kids are suffering, and you see other children that are out, and your kids friends and they’re out there and their lives are going on
And they’re continuing to do the things that they do on a daily basis, like going to dance class, going to preschool, going to birthday parties
My daughter can’t do any of that because of her counts
So we’ve basically stayed in the house for the last year
And I’ve got her doing a lot of art projects
I’ve got her doing music and stuff
But it’s really rough
Because it’s constantly in your face, and because of the fact that there’s the physical changes, the steroids they put them on
That’s why the kids have the huge cheeks and the big bellies
The physical changes and the hair loss, and there’s also the medications they get that makes hair grow in weird spaces
And those physical changes are so heartbreaking
It’s in your face all the time
You have to take care of your child, and everytime you look at them you know they’re so sick, and it’s right there
For the first six or seven months I probably cried like ten times a day
I would just have to dismiss myself and go to the bathroom, something would happen and it would trigger like a memory of “Oh when I was holding her down, and she was crying, and it’s bringing that back
A lot of parents experience that kind of thing
And nightmares, not being able to sleep, nighttime is a really hard time
Your kids are asleep, so you don’t really have to take care of them
So your mind starts going
So you think “Oh I saw a bruise on her, is that a sign of it coming back?” “Oh, she was a little nauseous this week, is the medication starting to have more side effects on her?” “Is she going to start having some of the symptoms that I’m seeing some of my friends kids have that are heartbreaking? Like having liver problems? Kidney problems? Heart problems?” If it goes into their spinal fluid, there’s just so many secondary conditions too that can be caused even by the treatment they’re on
So you’re in the hospital with your child and they’re giving them this chemo
And it says on the bag “hazardous
There are people that come in to give you child the chemo who are in a bubble suit, and they’ve got this syringe, and no one can touch the medicine because it will burn your skin
And they’re injecting this into my daughter, and I wanted to go over there and just smack the syringe out of the woman’s hand
But I have no other option, but this is what there is
It’s heartbreaking, chemo is horrible
You go into the hospital, and your’e faced with the exact same thing
You se all these other kids that are suffering
So even if your kid is having a good day, you could walk into the clinc and see kids who are having a horrible day, and that brings your mindset back to “Is my daughter going to be back in that spot? Is she going to make it through this, is she going to make it to the end of the two years without relapsing? If she relapses, is she going to die?”
And I mean you think about things like your child’s funeral
And you would never think about your child’s funderal, if you were not in this situation
And even if your daughter has a good chance of survival, you know it’s a terminal illness
It’s almost like you’re trying to mentally prepare yourself, just in case
Because you know that it’s going to be the most heart wrenching, soul crushing thing that could ever happen to you
It’s like your mind is trying to prepare yourself for it
It’s horrible
I actually have a friend who is, she has a son who is the same age as my daughter
She has the same illness
She had to go straight to transplate
She actually got sick, and she’s pregnant, and her husband is a truck driver, so he couldn’t go stay with her son
And she couldn’t stay with him because she was sick
And so there was no one to stay overnight with this 5 year old boy in this hospital
If there was somebody that could have come and spent the night with him, so that his mom knew there was somebody besides him besides the nurses
So they have to take care of multiple patients
I asked the nurse, and she said he was just pushing the call button all night long
Because he was scared and lonely
And they’re coming in, if he does fall asleep they’re coming in and doing his vitals every 20 minutes to wake him back up 
When you’re in that situation as a little kid, you need someone who’s on your team, who’s there to advocate for you, because kids can’t do that for themselves
And that’s one of those things that the community is really amzing at, advocating for each other
And being like wait a second, no that shouldn’t be happening
That’s a red flag you need to say something
Or I experienced that too, so don’t worry it’s going to be okay
It might be a little bit rocky, but we’re there to re assure each other and just you know
But the thing of it is that there isn’t any support groups for fmailes like this
And I askedm y social worker why, and he said every time they tried to create one, there would be no one to show up
Because everyone’s got all these different dontor’s appts all over the place
If there wa a place like ladybug house, where if you drop in theres always people there
Where you can vent, or be by yourself
OR say “I need someone to play with my kid for five minutes so I can go cry my eyes out in the bathroom, so she doesn’t need to see that
If you’re a teenager and you get diagnosed with cancer, you’re in the hospital for the first month, your parent Is by your bedside all the time, you’re used to having independence all the time that they just started to get, and it’s just taken from you like that, and they’re also super sick
So these kdis they need a place to go where their parents don’t have to worry about them, and they get a little space so they can heal better
Because you heal better when you’re comfortable, when you have support, when you have a group that cares, that’s rooting for you, that’s a team kind of thing
Fortunately for me, I had just had a baby six months before my daughter got diagnosed, so I was already staying at hom
And my husband makes enough money so we can get by by the skin of our teeth
So basically, they make those appointments for you
So they give you like a sheet and it has your appts list on it
So you know when you’re going to be there
So you go in, they access the port, that’s very traumatic, because the needle that they use looks like one of those safety tags that they put on clothing, so people won’t steal it
They connect that in there
Then they draw blood, and it goes off to the lab and you have to wait for an hour
And then you go in and you have your vitals done
And then you wait for the doctor and then your doctor comes in, and you meet with the doctor and he tells you what your daughter’s anc is, which is basically the number that determines whether or not she can be inpublic or if she has to be in isolation, or what
And right now he has to have that every 2 weeks, but at first it was a weekly and sometimes up to 3 times a week in terms of going in and doing that, having it checked, and going to a sleepy room and having them put her to sleep for 15 minutes, and then they do a lumbar puncture, which is basically a spinal tap, and then they see if there’s any leukemia cells in her sinal fluid
And every time they do that I get anxiety because I wonder if there’s going to be cells
Thankfully she has never had any in her spinal fluid
But still, it’s like, you hear stories about other kids, and you hear them about kids who have relapsed more than once
It’s hard
I would definitely say a far greater positive change at least for me and my husband
There’s a great community here in Seattle of cancer parents, and we’re all on the facebook page together
You can go on there anytime day or night, you can vent, you can ask a question
If you need to just say hi, or people go on there and just say hey I’m going to come to the clinic today does anyone in in-patinet need anything
It’s really cool because Everybody wants to support each other, and everybody wants to make sure the person next to them is okay
And going through this kind of a thing, when you meet somebody else that’s going through this too, you’re immediately bonded, and nobody else gets it except for the people who have been through it
And so when you meet someone, it’s almost an instant bond, and you want to support each other 
And there’s such a huge great network of parents and families who are out there supporting each other, helping each other out in different ways
There’s also the bad side of it where it’s too much for them
They don’t want to see a sick kid
They don’t want to witness your child possibly dying
Even if it ‘s one of your best friends
My best friend that I’ve had sine high school, shes an rn and she never has called me
I posted it on facebook because I couldn’t bring myself to call someone and tell them
She never called me 
And I was like you’re a nurse, I thought you’d be one of the first people to call me
It’s shocking, because it’s people you never expected, but at the same time people come out of the woodwork that you don’t know that want to help you
That want to do the things you thought your old best friend was going to do
In that way it’s really awesome
I’ve met some people that are like family now
And the nurses are too
Because you’re around them so much
They love those kids
It’s very clear, the nurses at seattle children’s are amazing
They love the children and it’s very apparent
That helps, and that’s another part of the community too is the nurses and the staff ,the doctors and the way that they treat the kids
The social workers
The people that run research programs that talk to you
They all have such great manners
Just really it’s an awesome – we are really fortunate to be – this is a horrible situation, but this is the best place to have it happen
I see people utilizing that so much because you need a place, especially if you’re coming from somewhere far away and you don’t have your house, you need a place where you can go and you can relax qnd rest and there’s somebody there if your child suddenly becomes ill
People will be able to go there and rest, and just actually rest, and not be woken up every 20 minutes by a nurse coming into do vitals, and still knowing that your kid is going to be okay
And if you’re a teenager needs a break from you, and they don’t need to be in the hospital
They can go there and they can stay
The parents know that their kid is going to be okay
It helps give them a reboost, to be away form their parents, to relax, to not be constantly asking them questions about how they’re feeling
It’s going to be so valuable, and families that need a place for their child to go and be if the’re really sick and the need care and the parents can’t get them back to their hosue and they want to take them there and let nature take its course if that’s what going to happen
And it’s going to be so great, and I think that it’s going to be good because of the fact that there’s going to be nurses and doctors, and the communities of seattle, as soon as it’s all together, it’s going to be aweswome
The support will be so great for the families to be able to know that they have the place and that it’s there
If you’re freaking out and you’re at home, and you’re like omg my 5 year old has been on steroids, she won’t stop screaming, shes eating every 2 min
I need to go stay there and have somebody else help me watch her, because I need a bit of a break
That little recharge can be the difference between melting down and losing it, and getting through it
It’s very valuable
You can’t put a price on it, being able to go there and everyone’s going to be okay
And you can relax and recharge if that’s what you need to do, and you can go there and rest
And be happy
And do fun stuff, and be away from the hospital, so …
